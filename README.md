# Titan

Titan is a PCI Express development card for the Lattice ECP5 FPGA. Titan is designed to be a cost optimized starting point for designs that use the Lattice ECP5 FPGA. The PCB was routed using Altium Designer. Altium is a commerical PCB layout tool, but a free viewer is available (see Links below).

# Titan Goals
* Cost effective
* [Limited feature set](https://github.com/c-e-s/titan/wiki/Features)
* Fully validated design
